### Scale Architect

For scaling the system that can serve milions of users, we can:

- Deploy API server with many instance and loadbalance for requests.
- Deploy databases with master/slave architecture.
- Store data in `tweets` table with sharding by location. Ex: Tweets created by Vietnamese is stored in server in Vietnam, 
tweets created by Singaporean is stored in server in Singapore.
